        <h1>NYCB ART SERIES PRESENTS SHANTELL MARTIN
            </h1>
            <h3>Shantell Martin</h3>
            <p>is a British artist whose been living in NYC for nearly a decade. 
                From her early beginnings with live performance drawings to sound, music and dance projected digitally in the mega clubs of Tokyo, 
                to her trademark stream-of-consciousness physical drawings here in the U.S., her work is a mediation of lines that invites people to share a role in the creative process. 
                Aside from her studio practice and numerous public installations, Shantell serves as an adjunct professor at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, and is a visiting scholar at the MIT Media Lab. 
                Her work has been seen in group shows at the Brooklyn Museum and Museum of the Moving Image, in solo exhibition at the Albright-Knox museum and MoCADA, 
                and in a 75-minute performance with Kendrick Lamar in 2016 during Art Basel Miami.
                </p>
                <h3>The basis for Art Series</h3>
                <p>The basis for Art Series lies in New York City Ballet’s rich history of working with visual artists. When the New York State Theater opened in 1964, architect Philip Johnson and NYCB Founder Lincoln Kirstein curated a permanent collection for what was to become one of New York City’s great public spaces, and included works by Jasper Johns, Lee Bontecou, and Elie Nadelman. In more recent years, other leading and emerging artists – luminaries like Keith Haring, Julian Schnabel and Santiago Calatrava – have collaborated with the Company in a variety of ways on and off the stage. Art Series builds on these traditions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Our aim</h3>
                    <p>Our aim is to cross-pollinate the disciplines of performing and visual arts – and their audiences – by annually inviting a contemporary artist to create a site specific work of art in our Lincoln Center home. Inspired by something as simple as movement, or as specific as our history, our dancers, or a piece of our world-renowned repertory, the Art Series installation is on view during the Company’s six-week winter performance period. Previous collaborators have included FAILE/Patrick McNeil & Patrick Miller, JR, Dustin Yellin, Marcel Dzama, Santtu Mustonen, and Jihan Zencirli.
